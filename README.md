## Objectives
* Create the following 3 pages
    * index.html
    * contact.html
    * portfolio.html

* Each page will include a navbar with links to the 2 other pages, have a responsive layout and responsive images
* Use Semantic HTML


### index.html
    Includes photo and a little bit about me.

### contact.html
    This page contains a form where you are able to send me a message.  The 'submit' button is not functional at this time

### portfolio.html
    I am displaying each of my assignments with cards to provide a short description of the project.  The buttons link to the github repository.  The pictures of each project are linked  to the 'assets' folder.  
    I also added a custom class within the cards because I did not like the sizing of the them when it broke at 992px. I changed it to 15rem at 992px and had it change back to 18rem when the screen size changed to 768px.

### style.css
    This is a custom style sheet that I included to further customize box models for my different pages
