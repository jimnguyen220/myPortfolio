# myPortfolio

This is my Portfolio page where you get to learn a little bit about me, a few projects and a few links  to my professional history.

The top of each page has a navbar that will link you to each page contained in this project.

Also in the navbar are links to my professional portfolio.  Here you will find links to my linkedin bio, github repo and a downloadable .pdf of my resume.
