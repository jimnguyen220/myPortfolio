## Objectives
* Create the following 3 pages
    * index.html
    * contact.html
    * portfolio.html

* Each page will include a navbar with links to the 2 other pages, have a responsive layout and responsive images
* Use Semantic HTML
* Verify code with an HTML Validation checker to ensure each page has valid HTML


### index.html
    Includes photo and a little bit about me.

### contact.html
    This page contains a form where you are able to send me a message.  The 'submit' button is not functional at this time

### portfolio.html
    This page has responsive images. Alt text has been added to describe each picture. 

### style.css
    This is a custom style sheet that I included to further customize box models for my different pages
