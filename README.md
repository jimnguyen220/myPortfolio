## Objectives
* Create the following 3 pages
    * index.html
    * contact.html
    * portfolio.html

* Each page will include a navbar with links to the 2 other pages, have a responsive layout and responsive images
* Use Semantic HTML
* Verify code with an HTML Validation checker to ensure each page has valid HTML


### index.html
    Includes photo and a little bit about me.

### contact.html
    This page contains a form where you are able to send me a message.  The 'submit' button is not functional at this time

### portfolio.html
    This page has responsive images. Alt text has been added to describe each picture. 

### style.css
    This is a custom style sheet that I included to further customize box models for my different pages

*note - github repository will also include portfolio3.html but is not going to be included in this project. Leaving it for reference with earlier pushes to github as that was earlier referred to as the portfolio.html page.
