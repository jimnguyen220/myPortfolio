## Objectives
* Create the following 3 pages
    * index.html
    * contact.html
    * portfolio.html

* Each page will include a navbar with links to the 2 other pages, have a responsive layout and responsive images
* Use Semantic HTML


### index.html
    For now, I'm just using a placeholder for my bio and Lorem ipsum for the text.

### contact.html
    I am using the "Accordion" component.  I feel like this is the cleanest way to display my contact information.  

### portfolio.html
    This page is labeled 'My Projects' for this assignment.  I am displaying each of my assignments with cards to provide a short description of the project.  The buttons link to the github repository.  The pictures of each project are linked  to the 'assets' folder.  The first screenshot is of the README file for my 1st assignment.  The second is a screenshot of my webpage so far.
