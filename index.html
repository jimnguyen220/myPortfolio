                        <p>
                          My name is Jim Nguyen and I am excited about jumping into this new world of Computer Coding. My educational background is in Psychology, but I somehow found my way into the financial industry where I have worked for the majority of my career. I enjoy that job and have been fortunate to have found success throughout my career, but one major difference between that and learning about coding is that coding has never felt like work! My hope is that as I continue to learn more about this exciting new world, that this passion continues - and further grows as I hopefully turn this into a career.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>
                          Some of my other interests include cooking and travelling. What I love about cooking is taking a bunch of unrelated ingredients and having them work together to create something delicious. In this way, I see a lot of simlarities to coding. Every ingredient or element brings their own unique characteristic and when combined with other elements or ingredients - creates something better. 
                        </p>

                          My Portfolio page displays a few pictures from different places that we have been to. What I love most about travelling is seeing things from a different perspective and learning about different cultures. If you have any questions about any of the images you see, feel free to get in touch with me through my 'Contact Me' page.
